### 4.1. Lyra

Lyra.ID is the base for this platform. A valid ID is needed to operate in the system

### 4.2. Rigel. Storing information

### 4.3. Arrakis : The economy in Alastria

Gas System

We will always follow a simple rule, gas has no price. Gas is usefull to fight spam, but we will keep our promise : The platform has no way of making money.

A Smart contract will act as Central Bank of Gas, receiving all fees and distributing them to all participants in the network. Everyon has gas to operate but nobody has has to speculate

### 4.4. Vega. Communications in Alastria

### 4.5 Endor. It's all about Pollitics.

### 4.6 Nebulosa
